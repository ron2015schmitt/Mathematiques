Now that you have completed installation, to use the Mathématiques library you need to 

1. Include the library file `include/mathq.h` in your source code
```C++
#include "mathq.h"
```
2. Include the `include/` subdirectory during compilation using the `-I` option

3. Include the `lib/` subdirectory during linking using the `-L` option

4. Include the option `-lmathq` during linking

## EXAMPLE Makefile

An example makefile, `example/Makefile`, is created during [configuration](configuration) for your convenience.

*AFTER CONFIGURATION*, copy this makefile to YOUR source code directory (or cut and paste into an existing makefile).

Here is an example of a [typical Makefile](doc/sample/Makefile).

## EXAMPLE Code File

An example of a C++ source file can be found at [examples/example.cpp](examples/example.cpp).

Compile the code and run the code using the Makefile
```bash
make example
./example
```
