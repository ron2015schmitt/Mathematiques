## Introduction

Mathématiques is numerical library that looks more like math than code. It can perform linear algebra, calculus, vector calculus, etc in C++ via simple MATLAB-like syntax while also providing run-time performance and memory usage of hand-coded C or Fortran.  

_Mathématiques distinguishes itself from other libraries by an elegance and versatility that are only possible using the features of C++11,14, and 17._
