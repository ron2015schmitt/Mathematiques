## Recursive MultiArrays (MultiArrays with MultiArray elements)

Implement code necessary so that mathematical operations work for recursive tensors, eg. `Vector<Vector<double>>`.  This allows for the most straightforward way to implement vector and tensor functions of space and time.


1. Methodology is to use `x.dat(index)``, for "deep indexing" that indexes from `0` to `deepsize()-1`, covering all the elements contained.  
1. For shallow indexing, ie first level indexing, use the `operator()` operators:
    1. `Scalar()` ✓ complete 
    1. `Vector(i)` ✓ complete 
    1. Expressions — in progress
       1. get `Vector<Vector<double>> + Vector<double>` working
       1. add `.dat(i)`, `.depth()`, `.deepsize()`, `setequals` vistor pattern etc methods to MultiArrayAbstract
       1. for each class `Scalar`, `Vector`, etc, use setquals pattern when inside equals (MArrayExpR) and uses deep indexing
       1. convert all binary functions in `functions.h` to the new methodlogy of `operator+`, including use of `NumberTrait`
       1. have alternate version of binary operators `addr` that uses recursion. This is faster in certain cases.
       1. convert all functors in `functors.h` to the new methodlogy of `New_Fun_Add` and delete old versions
       1. add test cases for math of recursive Vectors and scalars
       1. add access operator `(size_type...)` etc to expressions. This will allow e.g. Matrix expresssion to be used in dot products
       1. Use type traits to determine ideal qualifier types for paramters and return values? not needed when using visitor pattern
       1. asVector, asMatrix wrapper function expressions
       1. Benchmark a large vector of 3D vectors (of both types): see recursiveadd branch
       1. verify that `operator=` and `constructors` are paired in `scalar.h`, `vector.h`
    1. `Matrix(i,j)`  —  initiated
    1. `MultiArray(i...)`  — initiated
       1. number of dimensions must be a template parameter?

## MultiArray Dimensions as Template Parameters

Add template parameters for dimensions of each MultiArray class.  
* Each parameter should have the default value of 0
* If parameters are > 0, then the tensor is of fixed size and the `array` class is used for storage
* If paramters are == 0, then the tensor is of variable size and the class `valarray` is used for storage.  
* The static if construct,`if constexpr(expr)`, as introduced in `C++17` is used to select which code to enable, such as whether to use an `array` or `valarray`

### Matrix class
The `Matrix<D>` class has two size parameters.  The new class will be:

```C++
template class Vector<class D, int NR = 0, int NC = 0>
```
* if `NR>0 && NC>0` then use fixed size (`array`)
* if `NR=0 && NC=0` then use variable size (`valarray`)
* if only one of the values is greater than zero, then that dimension is fixed, but the other dimensions is variable and thus a `valarray` must be used.


### MultiArray class
The `MultiArray<D,int R>` class with Rank `R>=0` has size parameters.  Recall that R=0 is a scalar. The new class will use variadic template parameters.

```C++
template class Vector<class D, int R = 0, int ... Dims>
```
Likely don't need `R`, but may be useful for speficying if it can be resized, in which case better to change to `bool RESIZABLE`.

If not resizable, use static if's to enable one and only one element access function, for example if `Rank=3`

```C++
D& operator()(Index i1, Index i2, Index i3) {
  ....
}
```

Due to this, it is probably a good idea to not allow tensor to change rank, except by creating a new MultiArray, similar to rehaphing a vector into a matrix.
