# Imaginary number class

* make sure all operators implemented for complex are implemented with imag, real, and complex. 
* implement `+=`, etc
* make sure abs, arg, real, imag functiions work properly
* implement all common unary functions that complex numbers accept, simplify where possible
* use the same automated unit testing as used for `Scalar<D>`, `Vector<D>`, etc
