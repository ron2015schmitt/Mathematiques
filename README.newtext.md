Mathq is a comprehensive and cohesive syntax and library that looks like mathematics because it is designed around the natural objects definitions of modern mathematics. 

The definitions implement the popular and useful concept of duality in mathematics: vectors / covectors, bras / kets, etc.

Most definitions are based on multiarrays.

A tensor is a multiarray with added functionality.

A discretized function is a multiarray array with additional functionaility.

Multiarrays, funstions, and tensors can hold any numeric type: boolean, integer, real floating point, complex, quaternion, etc.
